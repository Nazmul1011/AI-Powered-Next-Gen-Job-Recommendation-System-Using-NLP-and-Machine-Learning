## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Users complete their profile or upload a resume.
2. Resume content and job descriptions are processed using TF-IDF.
3. A Python script matches users with jobs based on similarity.
4. Matched jobs are ranked and shown to the user.
5. Recruiters see applicants who are a good fit.

## 🤖 Machine Learning

- TF-IDF based keyword matching
- Resume and job description vectorization
- Cosine similarity used to rank jobs

*Future versions may use BERT for deeper context understanding.*

---

## 🔐 Security

- Passwords stored using PHP’s `password_hash()`
- Form validations for input and uploads
- File size/type checks for resumes

---

## 🚧 Future Work

- BERT-powered job recommendations
- Resume parsing with NLP
- Google/LinkedIn login support
- Notifications and interview tracking
- Mobile app version of the platform
